h1. p:siteURL

h2. Purpose

Renders an absolute URL pointing to your "point of entry" site.

Plugins and views can use this to refer to your site's URL in emails and views.

The default behaviour calls @g:createLink@ with @absolute="true"@ and a uri of "/" - therefore creating a link using the value of @grails.serverURL@.

You can have a site marketing URL different from your app's @grails.serverURL@ value by specifying the following configuration value:

{code}
plugin.platformCore.site.url = 'http://marketing.oursite.com'
{code}

See [siteLink|uiExtensionTags] for details of the site link tag that uses this and @p:siteName@.

h2. Example
